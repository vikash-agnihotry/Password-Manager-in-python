The PasswordManager file in this repository is a Python-based password manager application that utilizes the tkinter library for a graphical user interface (GUI) and provides features for secure password management. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

Key Features
1. User Registration & Authentication:

Users can register with a username, password, and a secret key for password recovery.
Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for secure storage.
The secret key is encrypted using the cryptography.Fernet library.

2. Password Management:

Users can save credentials (website, username, and password).
Passwords are stored in encrypted form using Fernet encryption.
Password Generation:

The app provides functionality to generate random strong passwords.

3. Password Retrieval:

Users can view stored passwords after decrypting them securely.
Password Deletion:

Users can selectively delete stored passwords via a GUI.

4. Password Import:

The app can import passwords from an Excel file (.xlsx), resolving duplicates or conflicts.

5. Account Deletion:

Users can delete their account, with an option to export saved passwords to a file.

6. Forgot Password:

Users can reset their password using the previously provided secret key.

7. GUI Design:

The application uses tkinter for a multi-window GUI with features like:
Login and registration windows.
Password search and retrieval.
Buttons, labels, text areas, and checkboxes for user interaction.

Technical Details

8. Encryption:

A Fernet key is generated on the first run and stored securely.
All sensitive data (passwords and secret keys) is encrypted.

9. Data Storage:

User data and passwords are stored in a local directory (passmgr_data).
Files are encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.
Hashing:

bcrypt is used to hash passwords before storing them.
Excel Import:

The app leverages the openpyxl library to read passwords from Excel files.

10. Error Handling:

The app incorporates message boxes to inform users about errors, warnings, or successful operations.

11. Execution Flow
  1. On the first run, the app prompts the user to register.
  2. If user data exists, it opens the login window.
  3. After a successful login, the main application window is displayed for managing passwords.
